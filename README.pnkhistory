pnkhistory

pnkhistory lists all files present in the root directory or a given subdirectory
of every backup entry, showing the first and last occurence of a file. Every
file which was at some point in a certain directory of the backup will be
listed.

Usage:

    pnkhistory <backup> [parameters]

Parameters:

    --subdir a certain subdirectory to list.

Examples:

    pnkhistory /backup/homedirs/ --subdir=joe

Assuming that pnkbackup made copies of /home/, pnkhistory lists the contents of
/home/joe, showing every file which is present in any version of /home/joe.
