pnkbackup

pnkbackup processes one or more backup jobs defined within config files.

Usage:

	lnkbackup.php <config file or directory>

Configuration:

lnkbackup processes either one configuration file or a directory containing
several configuration files ending with .conf, such as:

    conf.d/mailserver.conf
    conf.d/fileserver.conf
    conf.d/images.conf

Configuration files follow ini-format and must contain the following parameters:

    source      remote or local directory following rsync conventions, such as
                /data/fileserver or root@fileserver.example.com:/data/fileserver
    target      local directory containing backup, such as /backup/fileserver.

Configuration files may contain the following parameters:
    exclude		absolute path to exclude file, which will be given to rsync via
				--exclude-file.

Parameters:

	--force-date date as ISO 8601 to replace current date.

Process:

lnkbackup determines the current date or gets it from --force-date. Then a
temporary folder called „backup.temp“ will be created within the target
directory. After copying has finished, this will be renamed to <date>.

On each Sunday, first day of month or year, period files <date>.weekly,
<date>.monthly will be created. They will be created using cp -alv, using a
temporary directory "temp.period", which will then renamed to <date>.<period>.
If temp.period or <date>.<period> already exist, they will be deleted to be
created anew.

When several config files are used via config directory, lnkbackup will process
one job after another. Each job will use the same date which was determined
either when the script was called or given using --force-date.

Error Handling:

pnkbackup will try to finish all job even if one job fails. At the end of each
complete run, pnkbackup prints a list of successful and failed jobs.
